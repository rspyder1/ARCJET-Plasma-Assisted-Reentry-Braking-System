ARCJET: Plasma-Assisted Reentry Braking System

Concept by: Randall SimmonsLicense: MIT License (Attribution required)

🔥 Overview

ARCJET is a next-generation aerospace concept that combines plasma-based propulsion and reentry control into a single, dual-purpose system. Designed for both space and aquatic environments, it uses high-voltage plasma jets powered by solar, battery, and (theoretically) ionospheric charge sources.

Key Features:

Plasma-assisted reentry braking (non-combustion)

Electrically powered aquatic propulsion after splashdown

Multi-phase deployment: orbital braking → controlled descent → ocean mobility

Environmentally safe and reusable

🚀 Technical Highlights

Plasma Jets: Electrically ionized compressed gas expelled via electromagnetic nozzles

Compressed Gas System: High-pressure inert/atmospheric gas for thrust

Power Sources: Solar, onboard batteries, and ionospheric charge harvesting (experimental)

Failsafes: Back-arc suppression, self-cleaning ports, ionospheric jumpstart, CO₂ scrubbing

Marine Mode: Water-sealed jets enable clean propulsion in post-splashdown scenarios
