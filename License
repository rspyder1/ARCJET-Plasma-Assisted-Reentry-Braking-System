Project Title: ARCJET: Plasma-Assisted Reentry Braking System

Concept Owner: Randall SimmonsDate: [Insert Date]

Short Description (for GitHub):ARCJET is a dual-phase, plasma-assisted reentry and aquatic propulsion system that uses electrically powered ion jets for safe, eco-friendly descent and post-splashdown mobility.
